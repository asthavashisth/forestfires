🔥 Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using multiple meteorological and environmental features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The application is built with Flask for the backend and includes a user-friendly HTML form interface for predictions.

🚀 Features
Trained Ridge Regression Model

Standard Scaler for Input Preprocessing

Flask Web App with HTML Frontend

Real-Time FWI Prediction Based on User Input
